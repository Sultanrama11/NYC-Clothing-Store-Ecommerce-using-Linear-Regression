# **Linear Regression Analysis: E-commerce Customer Insights**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** to analyze and predict customer spending behavior for an e-commerce company in the apparel sector. The goal is to extract actionable insights and provide strategic recommendations to improve business performance.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains customer data, including:
- **Avg. Session Length**: Average time spent in sessions.
- **Time on App**: Time spent using the mobile app.
- **Time on Website**: Time spent on the website.
- **Length of Membership**: Duration of customer membership.
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: Target variable representing the annual customer spending.

The data is used to build a regression model to understand the impact of various features on annual customer spending.

## **Project Workflow**
### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
- Imported and inspected the dataset using Pandas.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib for insights into feature relationships.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized feature relationships with:
  - *Jointplots*: To explore pairwise correlations.
  - *Pairplot*: For a holistic view of feature interactions.
  - *Lmplot*: To analyze the linear relationship between features and spending.

### 3. **Modeling**
- Splitted the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
- Built a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluated model performance with metrics:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Explained Variance Score**

### 4. **Insights and Recommendations**
- Extracted feature coefficients to interpret the impact of each variable.
- Provided business recommendations based on data-driven insights.

## **Key Findings**
1. **Length of Membership**: The strongest predictor of annual spending. Longer memberships correlate with higher spending.
2. **Time on App**: More impactful on spending than time on the website. Enhancing app engagement could lead to higher revenues.
3. **Time on Website**: Minimal influence on spending. Website optimization should prioritize customer acquisition over engagement.


## **Business Recommendations**
- **Focus on Mobile Engagement**: Invest in improving app features to boost usage and customer spending.
- **Build Loyalty Programs**: Enhance membership benefits to retain customers and increase spending over time.
- **Optimize Website for Acquisition**: Use the website as a tool to attract new customers and transition them to app usage.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Experiment with advanced regression techniques like Ridge and Lasso Regression.
- Incorporate additional customer data (e.g., demographics, purchase history) to improve prediction accuracy.
- Develop a dashboard to visualize insights for business stakeholders.
